## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The current codebase is minimal, consisting mainly of configuration files. This provides a clean slate for creating the Tetris game. According to the project's conventions, the game will be placed in a new `tetris` directory.

### Current Architecture
There is no existing application architecture. The Tetris game will be a client-side web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the PixiJS library for rendering. A simple Node.js server will be used to serve the static files.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
- **PixiJS**: A fast, lightweight 2D rendering library. It will be used to draw the game board and Tetrominoes.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the web server.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### Considerations & Challenges
- **Game Logic**: The core game logic, including Tetromino movement, rotation, and collision detection, will be the most complex part of the implementation.
- **Performance**: While PixiJS is highly performant, care must be taken to optimize rendering to ensure a smooth experience.
- **Asset Management**: For this initial version, we will use simple geometric shapes for the Tetrominoes. In the future, we may want to add sprites and other assets.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Step 1**: Create the project structure.
   - Files to modify: None
   - Changes needed: Create a new directory named `tetris` in the root of the repository. Inside the `tetris` directory, create the following files:
     - `index.html`
     - `style.css`
     - `game.js`
     - `server.js`
     - `package.json`

2. **Step 2**: Set up the `package.json` and install dependencies.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/package.json`
   - Changes needed: Add the following content to `package.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "tetris",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "description": "A web-based Tetris game",
       "main": "server.js",
       "scripts": {
         "start": "node server.js"
       },
       "dependencies": {
         "express": "^4.17.1"
       }
     }
     ```
   - After creating the file, run `npm install` in the `tetris` directory.

3. **Step 3**: Create the basic HTML structure.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/index.html`
   - Changes needed: Add the basic HTML boilerplate and include a `<script>` tag for PixiJS and the `game.js` file.
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>Tetris</title>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
       </head>
       <body>
         <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pixi.js/5.3.3/pixi.min.js"></script>
         <script src="game.js"></script>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

4. **Step 4**: Style the game.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/style.css`
   - Changes needed: Add some basic styling to center the game canvas.
      ```css
      body {
        margin: 0;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 100vh;
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
      }
      ```

5. **Step 5**: Set up the PixiJS application.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/game.js`
   - Changes needed: Initialize the PixiJS application and create a container for the game.
      ```javascript
      const app = new PIXI.Application({
        width: 400,
        height: 800,
        backgroundColor: 0x1099bb,
      });
      document.body.appendChild(app.view);
      ```

6. **Step 6**: Implement the game logic.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/game.js`
   - Changes needed: This is the core of the game. The following steps will be involved:
     - Create the game board grid.
     - Define the Tetromino shapes and their colors.
     - Implement functions for moving, rotating, and dropping the Tetrominoes.
     - Implement collision detection.
     - Implement line clearing and scoring.
     - Add a game loop to update the game state.

7. **Step 7**: Set up the web server.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/server.js`
   - Changes needed: Create a simple Express server to serve the static files.
      ```javascript
      const express = require('express');
      const path = require('path');
      const app = express();
      const port = 8080;

      app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname)));

      app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Tetris app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
      });
      ```

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Play the game to ensure that all features are working as expected.
- **Code Review**: Review the code for clarity, correctness, and adherence to best practices.
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Test the game in different web browsers to ensure compatibility.

## üéØ Success Criteria
- The game is fully playable and free of bugs.
- The code is well-structured and easy to understand.
- The game is served on port 8080 as requested.
