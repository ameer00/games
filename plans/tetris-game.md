# Feature Implementation Plan: Tetris Game

## üìã Todo Checklist
- [x] Create the basic HTML structure for the game.
- [x] Style the game using CSS.
- [x] Implement the core game logic in JavaScript.
- [x] Create a Dockerfile for containerization.
- [x] Create a cloudbuild.yaml for deployment.
- [x] Final Review and Testing

## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The current codebase is empty. I will create a new directory named `tetris` and place all the game files inside it.

### Current Architecture
This will be a simple web-based game. The front-end will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application will be containerized using Docker and deployed to Google Cloud Run.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
There are no external dependencies required for this project.

### Considerations & Challenges
The main challenge will be implementing the game logic, including the movement of the tetrominoes, line clearing, and scoring.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- A web browser to play the game.
- Docker installed to build the container image.
- Google Cloud SDK installed to deploy the application.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Step 1**: Create the HTML file.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/index.html`
   - Changes needed: Create the basic HTML structure with a canvas element for the game.

2. **Step 2**: Create the CSS file.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/style.css`
   - Changes needed: Style the game board and other UI elements.

3. **Step 3**: Create the JavaScript file.
   - Files to modify: `tetris/script.js`
   - Changes needed: Implement the game logic, including the tetrominoes, game board, movement, rotation, line clearing, and scoring.

4. **Step 4**: Create the Dockerfile.
    - Files to modify: `tetris/Dockerfile`
    - Changes needed: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application. This will use a simple web server to serve the static files.

5. **Step 5**: Create the cloudbuild.yaml file.
    - Files to modify: `tetris/cloudbuild.yaml`
    - Changes needed: Create a cloudbuild.yaml file to build the Docker image and deploy it to Google Cloud Run.

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing by playing the game in a web browser.
- Verify that the game works as expected.
- Verify that the application can be deployed to Google Cloud Run.

## üéØ Success Criteria
- The Tetris game is fully functional and playable in a web browser.
- The application is successfully deployed to Google Cloud Run and accessible via a public URL.
