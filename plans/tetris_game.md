- [ ] Final Review and Testing

## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The current repository is a collection of games, with each game residing in its own directory. This project will create a new `tetris` directory at the root of the repository to house all the game's files, following the established convention.

### Current Architecture
This will be a new, self-contained web application. The architecture will be a simple client-server model:
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used for the game's UI and logic, running in the browser.
-   **Backend:** A lightweight Node.js server using the Express framework will serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
-   **Deployment:** The entire application will be containerized using Docker, making it portable and ready for deployment on GCP Cloud Run.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
-   **Node.js:** Required for the web server.
-   **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
-   **Docker:** For creating a containerized environment for the application.

### Considerations & Challenges
-   **Game Logic Complexity:** Tetris has a fair amount of logic to handle piece movement, rotation, collision detection, and line clearing. This will be the most time-consuming part of the implementation.
-   **State Management:** The game state (board, current piece, score, level) needs to be carefully managed.
-   **GCP Cloud Run Deployment:** The Dockerfile needs to be correctly configured to work with GCP Cloud Run, including setting the correct port and ensuring the container is stateless.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js and npm installed locally for development.
-   Docker installed locally for building and testing the container.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1.  **Create Project Structure**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris` directory
    -   Changes needed: Create the directory and the files within it.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `tetris` directory and all the necessary files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `game.js`, `server.js`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`).
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

2.  **Implement `index.html`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/index.html`
    -   Changes needed: Set up the basic HTML structure, include a canvas, and link to CSS and JS files.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `index.html` file with the basic structure, including the canvas for the game, score, level, and next piece display.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

3.  **Implement `style.css`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/style.css`
    -   Changes needed: Style the game container, canvas, and other UI elements.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `style.css` file with basic styling for the game layout.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

4.  **Implement `game.js`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/game.js`
    -   Changes needed: Implement the core game logic.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `game.js` file with all the game logic, including the game loop, player controls, collision detection, line clearing, and scoring.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

5.  **Implement `server.js`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/server.js`
    -   Changes needed: Implement a simple Express server to serve the static files.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `server.js` file with a simple Express server to serve the `index.html` and other static files.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

6.  **Create `package.json`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/package.json`
    -   Changes needed: Define the project name, version, description, start script, and dependencies.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `package.json` file with the project details and `express` as a dependency.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

7.  **Create `Dockerfile`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/Dockerfile`
    -   Changes needed: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `Dockerfile` to build the Node.js application into a container.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

8.  **Create `.dockerignore`**:
    -   Files to modify: `tetris/.dockerignore`
    -   Changes needed: Add `node_modules` to the `.dockerignore` file.
    -   **Implementation Notes**: Created the `.dockerignore` file and added `node_modules` to it.
    -   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

### Testing Strategy
-   **Implementation Notes**: 
    -   Ran `npm install` and `npm start` in the `tetris` directory and the server started successfully.
    -   Built the Docker image and ran the container successfully after resolving a port conflict.
    -   The application is now running in a Docker container on port 8080.
-   **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

## üéØ Success Criteria
-   A new `tetris` directory is created in the repository with all the necessary files.
-   The Tetris game is fully playable in a web browser.
-   The application runs on port 8080.
-   The application can be successfully containerized with Docker.
-   The container is ready for deployment to GCP Cloud Run.
