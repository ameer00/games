## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The current codebase is minimal, containing only project configuration files. As per the `GEMINI.md` guidelines, a new `tetris` directory will be created to house all the game-related files.

### Current Architecture
There is no existing application architecture. A simple client-server model will be adopted. The server will be responsible for serving the static game files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and the client-side code will handle the game logic using PixiJS.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
- **PixiJS:** A fast, lightweight 2D rendering library. It will be used for rendering the game graphics. We will use a CDN to include it in our HTML file.
- **Node.js/Express:** A simple web server will be created to serve the game files on port 8080.

### Considerations & Challenges
- **Game Logic:** The core challenge will be implementing the Tetris game logic, including Tetromino movement, rotation, collision detection, and line clearing.
- **Performance:** Ensuring smooth gameplay and responsive controls, especially as the game speed increases with levels.
- **Asset Management:** While this initial version will use basic geometric shapes, a more advanced version would require a strategy for managing graphical assets.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- A `tetris` directory needs to be created in the root of the project.
- A `package.json` file will be created inside the `tetris` directory to manage dependencies.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Step 1: Project Setup**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/package.json`, `tetris/server.js`, `tetris/index.html`, `tetris/style.css`, `tetris/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Created the `tetris` directory, `package.json`, `server.js`, and the `public` directory with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `game.js`. Added `express` as a dependency in `package.json`.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

2. **Step 2: Initialize PixiJS**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/index.html`, `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Initialized the PixiJS application in `game.js` and attached it to the canvas element.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

3. **Step 3: Implement the Game Board**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Defined the board dimensions, created a 2D array to represent the board state, and drew the grid lines on the PixiJS stage.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

4. **Step 4: Create Tetrominoes**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Defined the shapes and colors of the seven Tetrominoes. Created a function to generate a new random Tetromino and a function to draw it on the board.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

5. **Step 5: Implement Tetromino movement and rotation**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Added event listeners for keyboard input to control the Tetromino. Implemented functions for movement (left, right, down) and rotation. Added collision detection to prevent invalid moves. Implemented a game loop to update the game state.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

6. **Step 6: Implement Line Clearing**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Implemented line clearing logic in the game loop. When a line is cleared, the rows above are shifted down. Also created a function to draw the board state.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

7. **Step 7: Add Scoring and Levels**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Added scoring and level progression. The score increases based on the number of cleared lines and the current level. The level increases every 10 cleared lines, which also increases the game speed. The score and level are displayed on the screen.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

8. **Step 8: Implement Game Over**
   - Files to modify: `tetris/public/game.js`
   - Changes needed: [specific description]
   - **Implementation Notes**: Implemented the game over logic. The game ends when a new Tetromino cannot be placed on the board. A "Game Over" message is displayed, and the game loop is stopped.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing:** Play the game thoroughly to test all features:
  - Tetromino movement and rotation.
  - Line clearing and scoring.
  - Level progression.
  - Game over condition.
- **Unit Tests (Optional):** For a more robust solution, unit tests could be written for the core game logic functions (e.g., collision detection, rotation, line clearing) using a testing framework like Jest.

## üéØ Success Criteria
- A functional Tetris game is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
- The game implements all the core Tetris mechanics: movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring, and game over.
- The code is well-structured and follows the plan.
