# Game Folder Structure

When creating a new game, please adhere to the following folder structure:

1.  Create a new folder in the root directory of this repository.
2.  The name of the folder should be the name of the game (e.g., "tetris", "snake").
3.  All files related to that game should be placed inside this new folder.

## Example

If you are creating a game called "tetris", you should create a new folder named `tetris` in the root of this repository. All the files for the "tetris" game will be located inside the `/tetris/` directory.
