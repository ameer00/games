## Task At Hand
Implement a web-based Tetris game using PixiJS.

## User Request
"issue #3"

## Overall Plan
1.  **[Current]** Set up the basic HTML structure.
2.  Initialize PixiJS application.
3.  Implement the Tetris game board.
4.  Create Tetromino shapes.
5.  Implement Tetromino movement and rotation.
6.  Implement line clearing.
7.  Add scoring and level progression.
8.  Implement game over logic.
9.  Final Review and Testing.

## Current Step Rationale
This step sets up the foundational structure of the project, including the directory layout, server, and basic HTML/CSS/JS files. This is the necessary first step before any game logic can be implemented.

## Plan for this Step
1.  Create the `tetris` directory.
2.  Initialize a `package.json` file with `npm init -y`.
3.  Install `express`.
4.  Create a simple Express server in `server.js` to serve static files from a `public` directory and listen on port 8080.
5.  Create a `public` directory inside the `tetris` directory.
6.  Create a basic `index.html` file in the `public` directory, including a `<canvas>` element for the game.
7.  Create an empty `style.css` and `game.js` file in the `public` directory.
