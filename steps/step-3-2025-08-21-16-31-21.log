## Task At Hand
Implement a web-based Tetris game using PixiJS.

## User Request
"issue #3"

## Overall Plan
1.  Set up the basic HTML structure.
2.  Initialize PixiJS application.
3.  **[Current]** Implement the Tetris game board.
4.  Create Tetromino shapes.
5.  Implement Tetromino movement and rotation.
6.  Implement line clearing.
7.  Add scoring and level progression.
8.  Implement game over logic.
9.  Final Review and Testing.

## Current Step Rationale
This step is about creating the visual and logical representation of the Tetris game board. This is a fundamental part of the game, as it defines the playing area and the grid where the Tetrominoes will fall.

## Plan for this Step
1.  Define the dimensions of the game board (e.g., 10x20 grid).
2.  Create a 2D array to represent the board state.
3.  Draw the grid lines on the PixiJS stage.
