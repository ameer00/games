6.  Implement line clearing.
7.  Add scoring and level progression.

## Plan for this Step
1.  Add event listeners for keyboard input (left, right, down, up for rotation).
2.  Implement functions to move the current Tetromino left, right, and down.
3.  Implement a function to rotate the current Tetromino.
4.  Add collision detection to prevent the Tetromino from moving out of bounds or overlapping with other blocks.
